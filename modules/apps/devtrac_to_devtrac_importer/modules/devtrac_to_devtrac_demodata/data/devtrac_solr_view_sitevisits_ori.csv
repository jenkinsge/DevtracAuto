Issues:
Borehole discharge is 2.2 m3/h, which would contribute to about 22 m3/d. The reservoir tank of 90 cubic metre capacity would require more than 4 days of pumping to fill. Population is 1,500 people. Demand per day would be 30,000 m3, at¬†20 l/p/d. This is inadequate.
Together with LC III Chairman and¬†Parish Chief , attempted to identify other water sourcesto be connected to the system but with no success. There are 2 water sources that are broken down but both holes require fishing.
